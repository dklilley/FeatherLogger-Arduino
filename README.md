# FeatherLogger-Arduino
Arduino interface for BLE data retrieval.

This is part of a larger project, in which Android and iOS apps are used to retrieve stored information from a data logging unit based around an Adafruit Feather board (https://www.adafruit.com/feather). The code for these apps can be found in separate repositories under my account.

More about this projects and others can be found on my personal website: http://lilleypad.net.
